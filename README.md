# PowerFunctionInAssemby
A simple Assembly Language program designed to compute the power of one number to another. Users are prompted to enter two integer values, x and y, where y is the power to which x is to be raised. The program performs repeated multiplication to calculate x^y and handles edge cases such as y = 0 (result is 1) and x = 0 (result is 0). It provides a deep understanding of basic assembly operations, memory management, branching and looping in low-level programming.
